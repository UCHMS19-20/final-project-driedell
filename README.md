# Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2019

## Game Description and Instructions

This game was created as a final project for a programming course, and it has been coded using python and runs using pygame. The game is a "dodger" type game in which a player is represented as a rectangle on the bottom of the screen. The player can move left and right using the arrow keys. The goal of the player is to dodge the falling blocks, and if the player hits one of them, the game will stop. The falling blocks are generated with a set width and height, but the x-value that they fall on is random. Good luck players, and enjoy the game!
